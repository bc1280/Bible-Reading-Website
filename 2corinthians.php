            <ol>
                <li>Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians was a follow-up to his first letter. Point out some verses in chapter 1 that show us God's comfort in our afflictions.</li>

                <li>In 1:20, Who is the "yes" to all of God's promises?</li>

                <li>In chapter 2, Paul tells them he did not want to cause them sorrow, then exhorts them to forgive and comfort one who was punished. Who was the one punished?</li>

                <li>In 2:12-13, a door was opened for the gospel, but Paul did not enter through it. Why? Where was it that he felt no rest? (Note: the NIV paraphrases this verse; check a different version for a more accurate translation.)</li>

                <li>In 2 Corinthians 3:6, Paul introduces himself as a minister of the New Covenant. What is the New Covenant? What does he minister? What kills, and what gives life?</li>

                <li>In 3:17, Who is the Spirit?</li>

                <li>2 Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed. This is from the Greek word, metamorpho. What does this mean?</li>

                <li>What does Paul compare himself to in 4:7. What is inside?</li>

                <li>In 2 Corinthians 5:9, Paul says he wants to be pleasing to God. Why? (The answer is in verse 10). According to verse 10, who will have to appear before the judgement seat of God? Paul was a Christian, so do Christians have to stand before God and give an account?</li>

                <li>In 5:21, we see a great mystery. Christ was sinless, but what happened to Him for us?</li>

                <li>2 Corinthians chapter 6 describes the life of an apostle. What did Paul go through?</li>

                <li>2 Corinthians 6:18, according to a literal translation, says that we are sons and daughters to God. How many times in the Bible are both sons and daughters listed?</li>

                <li>Who comforted Paul in 2 Corinthians 7? What message did he bring?</li>

                <li>In 2 Corinthians 8, Paul describes the giving from the believers in Macedonia to the needy in Jerusalem. What is the principle we see in verse 14? What Old Testament reference is used to illustrate this principle?</li>

                <li>In 2 Corinthians 9, Paul continues to speak of giving. In 9:6 he brings out another principle. What is it?</li>

                <li>Paul describes his method of warfare in chapter 10. What is he fighting in 10:5?</li>

                <li>In 2 Corinthians 11:2, what does Paul say that the believers are? What did he do with them? Who is the husband?</li>

                <li>The second part of 2 Corinthians is a vindication of Paul's apostolic authority. What are his qualifications?</li>

                <li>Chapter 12:2-4 speak of an experience that Paul had. (He makes clear later that he is talking about himself). What was the experience?</li>

                <li>In order that Paul would not be proud, what was given to him? What did he ask God to do to give him relief? What was God's response?</li>

                <li>What does Paul ask the Corinthians to do in 13:5? Where is Christ located for those in the faith?</li>

                <li>2 Corinthians 13:14 lists all three persons of the Godhead. To each, there is ascribed something that they can give to us. Identify these three things, and define them.</li>
