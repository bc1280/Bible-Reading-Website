            <ol>
                <li>In the gospel of Mark, the word “immediately” is used over and over. This book portrays Jesus as the slave of God. How does “immediately” tie in with that thought.</li>

                <li>In Mark 2: 23-28, the Lord led His disciples to pick grain on the Sabbath. He then corrected the Pharisees on their understanding of the Sabbath. Explain.</li>

                <li>In the beginning of Mark 3, the Lord again “breaks” the Sabbath regulation. It seems as though He is doing this deliberately. Why do you think He did this?</li>

                <li>In the parable of the sower in Mark 4, the Lord explains what the thorns and thistles are. What are they, how can they choke the seed, and what are they in your experience?</li>

                <li>In Mark 5, what is the key matter for both the woman and the girl to be healed?</li>

                <li>Why could Jesus, who is God, not do many works of power in His own country in Mark 6?</li>

                <li>In Mark 6:30-44, how many people did Jesus feed? With how much food?</li>

                <li>In Mark 7:24-30, Jesus calls a woman a dog and she calls Him a crumb. And her daughter gets healed. Explain.</li>

                <li>When Jesus healed the blind man in Mark 8, what is the significance of His spitting on the man's eyes?</li>

                <li>In Mark 9:23, Jesus again points out what is needed for healing. What is it? Are you seeing a pattern?</li>

                <li>Explain what Jesus means in Mark 10:15 for us to be like little children.</li>

                <li>After healing blind Bartimaeus, Jesus says that what has healed him in 10:52?</li>

                <li>In Mark 11, Jesus cursed the fig tree. Bible scholars agree that the fig tree is a symbol of Israel. So what is Jesus really doing here?</li>

                <li>Should we pay taxes? This is answered in Mark 12.</li>

                <li>Is there a resurrection? This is also answered in Mark 12.</li>

                <li>I recently read the the Lord will return on October 21. Check what Mark 13:32-33 says to see if this prediction is accurate.</li>

                <li>When the Lord was praying in Gethsemane as referred to in Mark 14:36, he asked that this cup would be removed from Him. What was He asking? But Whose will was more important?</li>

                <li>On what day of the week was Jesus crucified? Support your answer (hint: there is more than one possibility).</li>

                <li>The Lord was resurrected in Mark 16. On what day of the week was this?</li>

                <li>When he appeared to two disciples in 16:12-13, why didn't they recognize Him?</li>
