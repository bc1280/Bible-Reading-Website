            <h4 class="w3-text-teal"><b>Exodus</b></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>The book of Exodus continues the story of the children of Israel, falling into slavery in Egypt, being set free, following God, and seeing the vision of His dwelling place on earth. Like the book of Genesis, there are many things that prefigure the reality of those items as seen in the New Testament. While there are many famous and wonderful stories in this book, keep looking for the intrinsic thought of God in these stories.</li>

                <li>What was the number of persons in the family of Israel that came down to live in Egypt? Once their number increased, what did the Egyptians do? Who initiated this plan (see verse 9 in chapter 1)?</li>

                <li>Chapter 2 begins the story of Moses. Which tribe of Israel did he belong to? How did he come to be in Pharaoh's household? How did God use his being brought up as an Egyptian? Was Moses even aware that he was actually a Hebrew?</li>

                <li>In 2:11-15, we see Moses taking some action. What did he do? Why did he do it? Did he have an intention to set his people free? What was the result? Where did he end up?</li>

                <li>What was the vision that Moses saw in chapter 3? What do you think the flame and the thornbush signify?</li>

                <li>What did God speak to Moses regarding His people?</li>

                <li>What does God say that His name is, in 3:14? What does it mean for God to say "I am." (Note, take a look at John 8:24, 28, 58. What does Jesus call Himself?)</li>

                <li>In chapter 4, Moses seems to be pointing out that he is not qualified and that no one will listen to him. What three signs does God tell Moses to use in 4:1-9? Can you think of what these signs signify?</li>

                <li>In 4:10-16, what excuse did Moses offer to again let God know he is not able? What does God provide to help Moses?</li>

                <li>Chapter 5:1-23 shows the first conflict between Pharaoh and God. What was God's request? What was Pharaoh's response? What did Pharaoh then do to the people? Please consider how this typifies Satan and his reaction whenever the people want to go to serve God.</li>

                <li>Chapter 6 shows God's encouragement and further training of Moses. What does God say about His name in 6:3? How old was Moses at this time (7:7)? Moses wrote in Psalm 90:10 how long a man should live. According to this psalm, how many more years did Moses have?</li>

                <li>Chapter 7:8-14 shows the second conflict between God and Pharaoh. What happened this time? Was Pharaoh convinced?</li>

                <li>The third conflict was the first plague on Egypt, in 7:15-25. What happened and how did Pharaoh react?</li>

                <li>The fourth conflict, the second plague, was frogs in chapter 8:1-15. After this, did Pharaoh agree to let the people go? Did he let them go?</li>

                <li>The third plague of lice in seen in 8:16-19. What was the Egyptian magicians conclusion regarding this plague? Was Pharaoh convinced?</li>

                <li>The sixth coflict, the fourth plague is seen in 8:20-22. What was it? Were the children of Israel affected  by this plague? How did Pharaoh bargain with Moses? Keep in mind, God's request was not just to let the people go, but to sacrifice to Him. Why couldn't they just make sacrifices in Egypt?</li>

                <li>Chapter 9:1-5 shows the fifth plague. What was it? Did Pharaoh then let the children of Israel go?</li>

                <li>The eighth conflict, the sixth plague takes place in chapter 9:8-12? What was it, and what was the result?</li>

                <li>In the ninth conflict in 9:13-35, there is some insight into why this is happening. What does God say in verses 14-16? After the hail, what was Pharaoh's response? Did he follow through on it?</li>

                <li>Chapter 10:1-20 shows the tenth conflict, the eighth plague. What was it this time? In verses 8-11, what did Pharaoh say he would allow? What does this show about Pharaoh's intention? Keep in mind that Pharaoh typified the enemy, Satan.</li>

                <li>In the eleventh conflict, darkness, what further bargain did Pharaoh make to be relieved of the plague? What was Moses' response? How did this set the stage for the final conflict?</li>

                <li>Chapter 11:1-10 outlines the tenth plague, the twelfth and final conflict between God and Pharaoh. What was it to be, and what would be the result?</li>

                <li>Chapter 12 gives us the story of the passover. We see had to be done in order for the people to escape God's judgment. In the New Testament, who is typified by the passover lamb? in 12:5, what qualification did the lamb possess? What was done to the lamb, to its blood and to its flesh? How is this type fulfilled in the New Testament?</li>

                <li>In 12:12, who was it that passed through the land to kill the firstborn? Were the children of Israel automatically spared from this judgment?</li>

                <li>Chapter 12:14-20 shows both the establishing of the feast of the Passover, as well as the feast of unleavened bread. Why unleavened bread? According to verses 15 and 19, there was a strict punishment for eating anything leavened. What do you think leaven signifies?</li>

                <li>In 12:30-36, we see the result of the final plague. What was it? Was it right for the Israelites to ask the Egyptians to give them all the valuable things?</li>

                <li>According to 12:40-41, how long had Israel remained in Egypt?</li>

                <li>Chapter 13 has more speaking from God regarding the establishing of the feast of the Passover. What were the Israelites to tell their children?</li>

                <li>According to 13:21-22, who led the Israelites? How did He do it?</li>

                <li>Why did Pharaoh pursue after the children of Israel in chapter 14? What did God say in 14:17-18?</li>

                <li>What did God do to help the people escape Pharaoh? What happened to all the Egyptians?</li>

                <li>The crossing of the Red sea typifies baptism. Consider all the events that occurred. If the passover was the salvation experience of the Israelites, and the crossing of the Red Sea is their baptism, then what does baptism accomplish for us? How important does this make baptism?</li>

                <li>After the victorious crossing of the Red Sea, we have the song of Moses in chapter 15. What impresses you in this song?</li>

                <li>At the end of chapter 15, the journeying of the children of Israel begins. They encounter different problems. At Mara, they needed water, but what was the problem? (What does "Mara" mean?) How was the problem solved. Can you see any relation between this solution and the cross of Christ?</li>

                <li>In chapter 16, the people were hungry. God gave them manna to eat. What does the word "manna" mean? Describe the characteristics of manna. Is there any possible natural explanation for this substance, at least that fits all of the characteristics?</li>

                <li>The people were thirsty again in chapter 17. How did God supply them this time? How does the rock in this story typify Christ?</li>

                <li>The people encountered Amalek and fought with them at the end of chapter 17. In the Bible, Amalek typifies the fallen, sinful flesh of mankind. This is why God hates it so much. What special need did Moses provide for the battle? How was he helped? Does this apply in any way to us?</li>

                <li>Chapter 18 portrays something of God's administration in His kingdom. What was the problem, and what advice did Moses receive?</li>

                <li>In chapter 19, the people arrived at Mt Sinai. They were now in the presence of God. What prohibitions did God make for the people. Why do you think it was so fearsome to be near to God? Can you think of any other portions in the Bible that give the same feeling about coming into the presence of God?</li>

                <li>Exodus 19:5-6 shows us God's desire for His people. What was it?</li>

                <li>In chapter 20, Moses begins to receive the law. The beginning is the 10 commandments. What are they? (Note: not everyone agrees on how to divide them).</li>

                <li>Chapter 21 continues with the giving of the law. In addition to the commandments, there are ordinances. What is the definition of a commandment, and what is an ordinance?</li>

                <li>Chapter 21:1-6 is a sweet and interesting ordinance. What is described here? Does it have any application to us?</li>

                <li>The next three chapters have many ordinances on our relationship with others. 21:24 is a famous verse. A big question to us is: are we as Christians still bound to obey the law? Did Jesus teach anything differently? To answer this question, you must differentiate between the principle of the law and the principle of grace, and between the moral aspect of the law and the ordinances of the law. This is quite a deep question; you can probably do a thesis on it.</li>

                <li>In chapter 23:14-17, what are the three feasts that Israel is commanded to keep?
                    The end of 23:19 is a sentence that is quoted in the New Testament. What is it? What is meant by this seemingly odd commandment?</li>

                <li>Exodus 23:20-33 is a promise from God to lead them into the good land. What are they commanded not to do? Why does God say he will not drive out their enemies all at once?</li>

                <li>Chapter 24 begins the enactment of the covenant between God and Israel. Who did God command to come up the mountain? Who alone was allowed to draw near to God? What did the others see? How long was Moses with God on the top of the mountain?</li>

                <li>Chapter 25 is on God's speaking to Moses concerning His heart's desire. We can assume that God would bring up the most important thing first. He begins with commanding a free will offering from the people. What was the offering to be used for? What it is shows us the thing that God is truly desiring.</li>

                <li>Chapter 25:9 shows us that God charged Moses to build the tabernacle, His dwelling place among men,  according to the pattern that God would show him. The tabernacle is a type, a picture, of the church in the New Testament. Since they were to follow God's pattern in building in the Old Testament, what should we do in the New Testament?</li>

                <li>What was the first item in the tabernacle that God revealed to Moses in 25:10. What was it used for?</li>

                <li>What was the second item of furniture in the tabernacle unveiled in 25:23? What was its purpose?</li>

                <li>What was the third item of furniture unveiled in 25:31? What was it made of, what was its function, and what did it look like?</li>

                <li>Chapter 26 begins to describe the construction of the tabernacle itself. How many layers of coverings were there? What were they?</li>

                <li>How many boards were used for the walls? How tall were they? Considering that they were overlaid with gold, how heavy were they?</li>

                <li>In Exodus 25:31, the veil is described. What was the purpose of the veil? Where was it located?</li>

                <li>Exodus 27 gives details on the outer court of the tabernacle. What is the main item in it? What was the function?</li>

                <li>Chapter 28 shows the garments of the priests for their service in the tabernacle. What were they? Verse 15-29 describe the focal point of the priestly garments, the breastplate. In verse 30, there are two things called the Urim and the Thummim. Do some research to find out what these crucial items were.</li>

                <li>Chapter 30 describes how Aaron and his sons were sanctified to become the priests. A bull and a two rams were sacrificed. What was done with their flesh and with their blood?</li>

                <li>We see more furniture of the tabernacle in Exodus 30. What was the function of the incense altar, and where was it located?</li>

                <li>There is also a bronze laver in 30:17-21. Was does the word "laver" mean?</li>

                <li>From 30:22-33 we have the holy anointing ointment. This is very deep in significance. What are the elements of this compounded ointment? Keeping in mind that oil typifies the Holy Spirit, what might be the significance of the four spices?</li>

                <li>In chapter 31, God completes His speaking on the tabernacle. What does God charge them to keep in 31:12-17? Why do you think He reminded them of this?</li>

                <li>In verse 31:18, God gave to Moses the two stone tablets of the law. According to the record of his being with God for 40 days, did God speak more about the law or the tabernacle?</li>

                <li>Exodus 32 is a very negative account of what the children of Israel were doing while Moses was on the mountain. In verse 1, what did they ask Aaron to do? What did Aaron do for them in verse 4? How could they have a feast to Jehovah using the idols that they made?</li>

                <li>From 32:7-29, we see Moses' response to the peoples' sin. What did he do? Which tribe was faithful in following God?</li>

                <li>In verse 30, Moses still asked for God to forgive the people. What did he offer to God in exchange for their forgiveness? How did God respond?</li>

                <li>Chapter 33 shows the aftermath of the peoples' failure. In verse 7, where did Moses pitch his tent? Why did he put it there?</li>

                <li>Moses went back up the mountain in chapter 34. He again spent 40 days and nights. He again received the tablets of the law. In verse 10, God established a covenant with them. What are some of the points of this covenant? In verse 29, what was the result of Moses' being with God for 40 days?</li>

                <li>Chapters 35-39 describe the preparing and building of the tabernacle and all the items related to it, done according to the pattern given by God. In 35:1-3, what reminder did God give to them?</li>

                <li>According to 35:4-29, how were the materials for the tabernacle obtained? in 35:30-35, who did the work? In verse 34, what did they do, and what does that imply concerning the building?</li>

                <li>Once the work was completed in 39:32-43, what did Moses do? Contrast this scene with the idolatrous worship seen in chapter 32.</li>

                <li>According to 40:17, when was the tabernacle raised up?According to verse 34, what was the result?</li>

                <li>Contrast the final scene in Exodus, the glory of God filling the tabernacle, with the final scene in Genesis, being buried in Egypt. What can you say about God's intention in delivering His people out of Egypt? Was it just to set them free? Or did he want something more for them?</li>
