            <br>
            <p><i>To read the word of God refreshes, nourishes, feeds, brings light, strengthens our faith. This is what I received this past year. </i> - M.I.</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>Reading the word of God is just like eating meals; we need to be consistent to stay healthy and grow normally. I'm not sure what's the spiritual equivalent to a growling stomach to remind me to eat God's word as my daily food but the Badger Bible Reading challenge served that purpose. </i> - Anon.</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>It's always a good habit to read the Bible and many times we want to read but we find excuses or just plain forget. Having a schedule is the only way I've ever been able to consistently read the Bible all the way through and this challenge helps to make it even easier to access and keep track of my progress. </i> - G.L.</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>I have developed a somewhat better understanding of the bible. </i> - S.O.</p>
