            <ol>
                <li>Who wrote the epistle to the Romans? Why do some consider this book the fifth gospel?</li>
                <li>How do Romans 1:4-5 show both Christ's humanity and divinity? How was He shown to be the Son of God?</li>
                <li>How is the gospel the power of God unto salvation?</li>
                <li>From verse 18 of chapter 1, we begin to see God's condemnation on various groups of people. Which group is listed first?</li>
                <li>Which two groups are shown to be under God's condemnation in chapter 2?</li>
                <li>What does it mean to be circumcised in heart?</li>
                <li>Chapter 3 continues to show God's condemnation. From verse 9-20 we see a fourth group. Who is it?</li>
                <li>From Romans 3:21 through 5:11, we have a long section on justification. What does justification mean? Why does it follow God's condemnation?</li>
                <li>In 3:23, what does it mean to fall short of the glory of God?</li>
                <li>Romans chapter 4 is an example of Abraham being justified by faith. Explain this example.</li>
                <li>What does 4:25 mean when it says that Christ was delivered for our offenses but raised for our justification. We normally say Christ died for our sins, so how is His resurrection tied in with justification?</li>
                <li>Chapter 5:9-10 speak of being saved after having been justified, and being saved much more in His life after having been reconciled. If we have already been justified and reconciled, what does it mean to be saved much more?</li>
                <li>Romans 5:12-8:11 is a long section on the matter of sanctification. What does sanctification mean?</li>
                <li>What does Romans 6:4-5 say about baptism?</li>
                <li>Why is important for us to be identified with Christ in His death? How does this help us to overcome sin?</li>
                <li>Romans chapter 7 presents a struggle with the flesh. If you look into it, you can find three "laws". What are they? Where are they located? (Hint: the first is the law of God, located outside of us). Which law is the strongest? What is the result of the interaction of these three laws?</li>
                <li>Romans 8:1 show us where we need to be in order to escape condemnation. Where is it?</li>
                <li>Romans 8:2 shows us a fourth law, stronger than the first 3 in chapter 7. What is it?  What does it do?</li>
                <li>How do we fulfill the righteous requirement of the law in verse 4?</li>
                <li>In Romans 8:9, which Spirits are in us? Who is in us in verse 10. And which Spirit is in us in verse 11? Based on all of these, what can we say about the Spirit, God, and Christ?</li>
                <li>In Romans 8:14-39, we see the matter of glorification. What does glorification mean?</li>
                <li>In this section, what is the difference between children, sons, and heirs?</li>
                <li>From chapter 9:1 through 11:36, we can see God's selection. How do we see this?</li>
                <li>In chapter 10:9-10 we see a concise gospel. What does it say that we must do in order to be saved? And what are we charged to do in verse 13? And in verse 15?</li>
                <li>What is the source of our faith, as seen in Romans 10:17?</li>
                <li>Romans chapter 11 speaks about branches being grafted into the tree. What is meant by this illustration? Compare this with John chapter 15.</li>
                <li>Romans 12 speaks of our practice of living in the Body of Christ. Verse 2 tells us not to be conformed to the world, but to be transformed. What do it mean to be transformed? How is our mind involved in this process?</li>
                <li>What do verses 4-8 say about our function in the Body of Christ? What does this look like? How many bodies does Christ have?</li>
                <li>What does chapter 13 say about how we conduct our human life?</li>
                <li>Chapter 14 begins with a section of receiving one another, and not judging one another. What do you see here? What does verse 17 say about eating?</li>
                <li>In Chapter 15:16, Paul likens himself to a priest. What is his duty? How are the Gentiles begin offered as a sacrifice?</li>
                <li>In Chapter 16, Paul asks that they greet many people that he names. Why do you think he did this, and not just tell them to greet everyone?</li>
                <li>In verse 17, he says they should mark certain disobedient ones. What is the first thing he warns them about? Why do you think this is listed first (hint: this book if very much about the Body of Christ).</li>
