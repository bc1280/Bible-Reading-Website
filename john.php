            <ol>
                <li>What point in time does John 1:1 refer to? Who is the Word? Why do you think this term (Word) is used?</li>

                <li>According to John 1:12-13, what happens to us when we believe into His name?</li>

                <li>What Old Testament story is John 1:51 referring to?</li>

                <li>Other than being a cool miracle, what is the significance of Jesus changing water into wine in John 2?</li>

                <li>In John 3, Nicodemus, a teacher, comes to the Lord (at night) seeking some teachings. What does the Lord give him instead? Do you think this blew Nicodemus' concepts?</li>

                <li>John 3:16 is a famous gospel verse. You see it in the endzone at every football game. For extra credit, look up the Greek word for “eternal life” (often translated at everlasting life) in this verse. If you need to, ask how many different Greek words can be translated as “life”, and what kind of life do they refer to?</li>

                <li>Using the story in John 4, trace how the Lord preached the gospel to the woman at the well.</li>

                <li>In John 5, we see a crippled man who is not able to be made well, due to the requirements placed on him to try to help himself. Show how this is a reflexion of the Jewish religion's impotence in being able to save him (hint: where did this take place? When was he healed? What was the Pharisees' response? What did Jesus do to heal him: see verse 14 for a clue?)</li>

                <li>In John 6, the Lord does a great miracle to feed 5000. But then He points to the true meaning of eating, of Himself. Why did so many leave Him after this? Is the Lord saying we should be cannibals?</li>

                <li>In John 7, what are the rivers of living water referred to in verse 38? Explain the significance.</li>

                <li>In John 8, who was the only one qualified to forgive the sinful woman? After forgiving her, what did her charge her not to do? Apply this story to modern society.</li>

                <li>Compare verses 8:32 and 8:36. What do you see?</li>

                <li>Why did the Jews try to stone Jesus in 8:59? See 8:58 for the answer.</li>

                <li>John 9:3 shows an aspect of God's sovereign arrangement that is contrary to human thought. What is it?</li>

                <li>Why did the Pharisees cast the healed blind man of the temple? What is the significance of this?</li>

                <li>John 10:10 is a famous verse that is almost universally misapplied. If you don't already know, realize that there are three different Greek words that are translated as “life” in English. Look up which of the three Greek words is used for “life” in this verse. (Compare it to the word for “life” in verse 11). Discuss what this really means, and apply it to us.</li>

                <li>The story of the resurrection of Lazarus in John 11 is well known. But the deep significance is often misunderstood. John 11:35 is the shortest verse in the Bible. Why did Jesus weep? Please think about it before you answer.</li>

                <li>John chapter 12 may be considered the high point of Jesus' earthly ministry. People were thronging to see Him. His response is encapsulated in John 12:24. What is the Lord saying here? In using this illustration, what is the significance to us, ie. what does this mean about our relationship with the Lord? (John is a deep and mysterious book).</li>

                <li>In John chapter 13, before the Lord's crucifixion, he washed the feet of His disciples. He charged us to do the same thing. How do you apply this?</li>

                <li>John chapters 14-17 are likely the deepest in the entire book, maybe in the entire Bible. In 14:2-6, where did the Lord say He was going? Compare 14:2 and 14:23. (Note: the use of the word “mansion” in verse 2 as in the King James version is a mistranslation). The same Greek word is used for “abode” or “dwelling place” in these two verses. What is the dwelling place that the Lord is talking about? Then what is the Father's house in verse 2? Again, where was the Lord going?</li>

                <li>What is the significance of the Lord comparing Himself to the vine, and us to the branches in John 15:5?</li>

                <li>In John 16:12-13, the Lord seems to say that the disciples cannot understand what He is talking about. What will be the solution for that?</li>

                <li>John 17 is the Lord's final prayer before He is crucified. He first prays that the Father would be glorified. What does “glorified” or “glory” mean? Then He prays for oneness. This can be seen best in verse 21. What does the oneness of the believers cause the world to do?</li>

                <li>In John 18:17, who did Peter deny the Lord to?</li>

                <li>John 19:34 is an account found only in the gospel of John. What is the significance of blood and water coming from the Lord's side?</li>

                <li>In resurrection, the Lord returned to the disciples, even though the door was shut (probably locked). What did he do in verse 22? What does this mean?</li>

                <li>John 21 can be considered an appendix to this book. This is an account of the Lord strengthening Peter's faith. How many times did the Lord ask Peter if he loved Him? How many times did Peter deny the Lord?</li>
