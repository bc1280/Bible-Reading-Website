                <li>According to Ephesians 1:4, when were we chosen by God? And in verse 5, what are we predestinated to become?</li>

                <li>Ephesians 1:9-10 show us that God has made known to us the mystery of His will. What is it?</li>

                <li>What does Paul pray for the believers to have in 1:17-21?</li>

                <li>What is the church, as seen in 1:22-23?</li>

                <li>By what means are we saved, as seen in Ephesians 2?</li>

                <li>In Ephesians 2:14, who are the two parties that Christ has made one? How did he do this (see the next verses)?</li>

                <li>According to Ephesians 3:9-11, how is God's wisdom seen? What is God's eternal purpose? (Note: this is a big point. If God has an eternal purpose, and it is revealed in the Bible, then we should certainly know what it is!)</li>

                <li>What does does Paul pray for in Ephesians 3:14-19?</li>

                <li>In the beginning of chapter 4, how many things can you count that there are just one of?</li>

                <li>According to 4:11-13, what kinds of persons did Christ give as gifts? What are they supposed to do? What is the goal of their function?</li>

                <li>In Ephesians 5:16, what are we do with our time? Why?</li>

                <li>What two things can we be drunk with in 5:18?</li>

                <li>Describe Paul's thought in 5:23-33. Hint: what things are he comparing?</li>

                <li>What are the parts of the whole armor of God described in Ephesians 6:11-18? What is the function of each and how do we use them?</li>
