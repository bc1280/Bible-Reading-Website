            <ol>
                <li>What is the church called in 1 Corinthians 1:2? What does this mean?</li>

                <li>The epistle to the Corinthians was written to address many problems in the church. What is the first problem that Paul pointed out in 1:10? Since this was the first problem, it probably was the biggest. Why could this problem be seen as the biggest problem? Why shouldn't we say that we follow different people?</li>

                <li>Paul preached Christ crucified in 1:23. Why did he preach the crucified Christ to the Corinthians?</li>

                <li>In 1 Corinthians 2:11-16, Paul speaks of the difference between a spiritual man and a natural (lit. soulish) man. Why can't the natural man understand spiritual things?</li>

                <li>What does Paul liken the believers to in 1 Corinthians 3:9?</li>

                <li>What is Paul talking about in 3:10-15? What is our work; what are we building?</li>

                <li>In 1 Corinthians 4:1-2, Paul likens himself to a steward. What does a steward do?</li>

                <li>Chapter 5 deals with the matter of fornication. In verse 6 it says a little leaven leavens the whole loaf. In the Old Testament, there was the feast of the Passover which started the feast of unleavened bread. How is Paul applying the type of these feasts to this situation?</li>

                <li>Chapter 6 deals with lawsuits between believers. What does Paul exhort us to do in this case?</li>

                <li>Verse 6:17 says that we are one in what way with the Lord?</li>

                <li>1 Corinthians 7 is a chapter on marriage. Why is it good to marry? For what reason should a believer remain married to an unbeliever?</li>

                <li>Chapter 8 concerns the matter of eating things that may have been offered to idols. According to verses 8-9, is it okay for us to eat food that was sacrificed to an idol? What about the feelings of others (v. 13)?</li>

                <li>In 1 Corinthians 9:19-23, what did Paul become for the sake of the gospel?</li>

                <li>How does Paul encourage them (and us) in 10:13?</li>

                <li>In 1 Corinthians 10:17, what is the connection between the one bread and the one Body?</li>

                <li>In 1 Corinthians 11:3, who is the head of every man? Who is the head of the woman, the wife? Who is the head of Christ? So what is the significance of head covering?</li>

                <li>In 11:23-24, what does the bread signify? What does the cup signify?</li>

                <li>1 Corinthians 12 begins a section on spiritual gifts. What types of gifts are listed in verses 8-10?</li>

                <li>Paul emphasizes the different functions of each member. In 12:14-27, what does he use to illustrate this thought? What matter is reinforced in verse 25?</li>

                <li>According to 12:29-30, do all have the same identical gift? Does everyone have the gift of speaking in tongues?</li>

                <li>Chapter 13 lays out the most excellent way for us to exercise whatever gift we might have. What is this way?</li>

                <li>In 1 Corinthians 14:1, we are encouraged to prophesy. Since we are encouraged to do so, what does it mean to prophesy?</li>

                <li>In chapter 14, is Paul either encouraging or discouraging the speaking in tongues? Why?</li>

                <li>1 Corinthians 15:12-19 deal with the resurrection of Christ. Verse 17 says that if Christ has not been resurrected, we are still in our sins. Normally we associate the death of Christ with forgiveness of sins. Is there a discrepancy?</li>

                <li>According to 15:35-44, what will our body be like when we are resurrected?</li>

                <li>I Corinthians 16 ends with some greetings. Who greeted them in verse 19? Any familiar names?</li>
